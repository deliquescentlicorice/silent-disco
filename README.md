# Socket Radio
A real-time streaming audio application for broadcasters and listeners.

## Live version of Socket Radio
Broadcast and listen at this address: https://www.socketradio.com

## Tech stack
This project was built in JavaScript with a Node.js/Express server. 
We used React for a responsive front-end, a non-relational MongoDB database,
and binary sockets to stream music from the client to the server.

## Challenges
Our core technical challenge was streaming audio in real-time from client to server. We experimented with several possibilities and eventually settled on binary sockets,
